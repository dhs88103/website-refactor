# website code refactor

## Description
My motivation was to rework the code for this website to conform to the client's expectations.
I refactored the index.html to have more semantic elements and added accessibility alts to all images.
I learned to cross-reference my CSS sheet with my HTML code to check and see if they were clashing with each other when changing element names.  Particularly changing the nav section inside of the header.
